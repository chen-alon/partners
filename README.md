# Hitchhiker Application

Developed an Android application that helps travelers to find the perfect partners for traveling in Israel and abroad - based on matching percentages

The user has to fill his personal details (his destiny, the dates, gender and ages he wants 
to travel with) and then answer a quick quiz - the application will work for the user and
matching his travel buddies. 

The system will show the user only the potential partners for him.
